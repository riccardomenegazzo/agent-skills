# Agent rules

## Audience

The skills in this repository are consumed operationally by agentic frameworks (AI coding agents, copilots, and autonomous developer tools).
Every piece of guidance must be written so that an agent can act on it without human interpretation.

When writing or editing skill content, follow these principles:
- **Be prescriptive, not descriptive.**
  Tell the agent what to do (`Use a Histogram`) rather than explaining concepts (`Histograms capture distributions`).
  Explanations are acceptable only when they inform the decision.
- **Make decisions enumerable.**
  When multiple options exist, provide a numbered decision process, a lookup table, or explicit criteria — not open-ended advice.
- **Include code examples for every actionable rule.**
  An agent generating code needs a template to follow.
  Show both the correct pattern and, where useful, the incorrect one labelled `// BAD`.
- **Avoid subjective conditions.**
  Do not write "if the user wants" or "it is likely that."
  State concrete, testable criteria the agent can evaluate from the code or configuration it has access to.
- **Keep rules self-contained.**
  An agent may load a single rule file without reading the rest of the skill.
  Each file must make sense on its own; use cross-references for detail, not for essential context.

## Skill separation of concerns

### `otel-instrumentation` vs `otel-collector`

These two skills have a strict boundary: **application code vs Collector configuration**.

- **`otel-instrumentation`** covers the application and its deployment: SDK setup, environment variables (`OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`, `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`, etc.), resource attributes, instrumentation libraries, and the Kubernetes workload resources and pod specs that deploy the application (e.g., downward API configuration, container env blocks, secret references for auth tokens in Kubernetes).
- **`otel-collector`** covers what happens inside the OpenTelemetry Collector process: receivers, processors (`memory_limiter`, `batch`, `k8sattributes`, `resourcedetection`, `resource`), exporters, pipelines, and Collector deployment manifests (e.g., DaemonSet and Deployment in Kubernetes, Docker Compose).

When content could live in either skill, apply this rule: if the guidance tells an agent how to modify **application code or deployment specs**, it belongs in `otel-instrumentation`; if it tells an agent how to modify **Collector YAML configuration or Collector deployment manifests**, it belongs in `otel-collector`.
Cross-reference the other skill for context, but do not duplicate Collector configuration in `otel-instrumentation` or SDK/pod-spec configuration in `otel-collector`.

## Keeping SKILL.md index lists in sync with rule files

Some `SKILL.md` files contain a bullet list that mirrors the `##` headings in a referenced rule file (marked with a `<!-- keep-in-sync -->` comment).
When adding, removing, or renaming a `##` heading in the rule file, update the corresponding list in `SKILL.md` so the entries match one-to-one.

## Eval rules

The eval harness in `evals/custom/` runs an agent against the skills and validates every fenced example; the operator manual is [evals/custom/README.md](evals/custom/README.md).
Follow these rules when changing skill content:

- **Register every added or renamed rule file in the eval registry.**
  Classify it as `dedicated`, `shared`, or `exempt` in `evals/custom/harness/registry.go`, and for `dedicated` files declare a scenario in `evals/custom/scenarios/` or a `pendingScenarios` entry.
  The registry completeness test fails CI on unclassified files, stale entries, and uncovered dedicated files.
- **Every fenced example must validate or carry an `eval:` annotation.**
  Unclassifiable blocks fail CI; use `<!-- eval:skip -->`, `<!-- eval:fragment -->`, `<!-- eval:k8s -->`, `<!-- eval:cloudformation -->`, or `<!-- eval:collector-config -->` per the annotation table in [evals/custom/README.md](evals/custom/README.md).
  `<!-- eval:fragment -->` is context-aware: on a `yaml` or untagged block it marks a service-less Collector fragment, and on an SDK-code block it marks a code fragment that is reported but not compiled — use it on a genuinely-complete Go block only when the block is deliberately uncompilable, never to hide a real compile failure.
- **Mark deliberately wrong examples.**
  Use a `// BAD`-style line comment or `<!-- eval:bad -->` so the validator exempts them.
- **Keep fixture data synthetic.**
  Only reserved example domains and `TEST-`-prefixed identifiers, for example `user@example.test` and `TEST-0001`; see [evals/custom/fixtures/README.md](evals/custom/fixtures/README.md).
- **Expect code-owner review on prompt-bearing paths.**
  Changes under `skills/**` and `evals/custom/scenarios/` require approval from the owners in `.github/CODEOWNERS` before eval workflows run them.

### Two eval systems

The `evals/` tree carries two independent eval systems, and the rules above apply to the Go harness in `evals/custom/`.
The Tessl-format scenarios in `evals/tessl/` are a separate system: one scenario per subdirectory with a `task.md` and a `criteria.json` weighted-checklist rubric, scored by Tessl's LLM judge at publish time rather than run by the Go harness.
When adding a Tessl scenario, place it directly under `evals/tessl/` (Tessl does not discover nested subdirectories) and keep its task fixtures synthetic; see [evals/tessl/README.md](evals/tessl/README.md).

## Prose rules

Follow these rules when writing or editing prose in this project.

### Line and Paragraph Structure
- **One sentence per line** (semantic line breaks).
  Each sentence starts on its own line; do not wrap mid-sentence.
- Separate paragraphs with a single blank line.
- Keep paragraphs between 2 and 5 lines (sentences).

### Section headers
Section headers should be written in sentence case, e.g., "This is an example".

### Links
- Use inline Markdown links: `[visible text](url)`.
- Link the most specific relevant term, not generic phrases like "click here" or "this page."

### Code Blocks
- Fence with triple backticks and a language identifier (e.g., ` ```yaml `).
- Use code blocks to provide illustrative examples.

### Punctuation and Typography
- End sentences with full stops.
- Use the **Oxford comma** (e.g., "error status, latency thresholds, rate limits, and so on").
- Use curly/typographic quotes in prose (`"..."`, `'...'`); straight quotes are fine inside code blocks.
- Write numbers as digits and spell out "percent" (e.g., "10 percent", not "10%" or "ten percent").

### OpenTelemetry terminology
- Write span status codes in all-caps: `UNSET`, `OK`, `ERROR`.
  Do not use mixed case like `Ok`, `Error`, or `Unset` in prose.
- Write log severity levels in all-caps: `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, `FATAL`, `UNSET`.
- In code examples, follow the casing of the SDK API (e.g., `SpanStatusCode.ERROR`, `SeverityNumber.INFO`).
